# SoftGame

1. 144 sprites were created (NOT graphics object) that are stacked on each other like cards in a deck(so object above covers bottom one, but not completely). 
Every second 1 object from top of stack goes to other stack - animation of moving during 2 seconds long. 
So at the end of whole process has reversed stack. 

2. Created the tool that allow mixed text and images in an easy way (for example displaying text with emoticons or prices with money icon). It comes up every 2 seconds a random text with images in random configuration (image + text + image, image + image + image, image + image + text, text + image + text etc) and a random font size.

3. Particles - make a demo that shows an awesome fire effect. Please keep number of images low (max 10 sprites on screen at once). Feel free to use existing libraries how you would use them in a real project. 
(Unfortunately still in progress in STEP-4-third-part branch).
